FIXED BUGS in version 2.0.4 with respect to version 2.0.3

- The Glite adaptor has seen various updates and fixes, but its file
  adaptor is still to be considered "experimental", according to the developers.
- various fixes in the Globus File adaptor.
- File.getName() returned null in some cases, which is a no-no. This is fixed,
  and this also fixes bug 187.
- re-implemented metrics administration. The old method maintained static lists
  inside GATEngine which were never cleaned up, so that there was a huge memory
  leak because the engine kept references to all jobs that were ever run.
  Now, the lists are maintained within the monitorable object itself and are
  no longer static. This fixes bug 134.
- fixed stop() method of almost all resourcebroker adaptors: the method
  may now be called in any job state, as promised in the javadoc.
- fixed wsgt4new resourcebroker adaptor to actually use a user-supplied
  credential (bug reported by Ralf Groeper).
- fixed sshtrilead and commandlinessh resource broker adaptors to prevent
  expansion of shell-meta-characters, and to make them work in case the
  shell on the server side is a C-shell (bug reported by Kees van Reeuwijk).
- made resourcebrokeradaptor test work when server is a Solaris machine
  (which has slightly different error messages).
- fixed wsgt4new resourcebroker adaptor to use a supplied GSSCredential (bug
  reported by Ralf Groeper).
- fixed classloader issue: use either the classloader of the class that
  prompted the loading of JavaGAT or the context classloader, for the
  parent of the URL classloaders for the adaptors (bug reported by
  Ralf Groeper).
- fixed globus security utils: if the CredentialSecurityObject already
  contains a GSSCredential, just return that instead of ignoring it
  (bug reported by Ralf Groeper).
- fixed commandrunner: now uses ProcessBuilder. This protects against local
  expansion of shell meta characters.
- fixed a bug reported by Brian Carpenter: wsgt4new resourcebroker adaptor
  sometimes gave redundant callbacks when the job was already finished,
  for instance, a redundant POST_STAGING callback, which caused overwriting of
  initially correct output files.
- fixed copy method to mimic cp -r behaviour when copying directories.
  (copy dir a to b ended up as a copy b/a, even if b did not exist,
  now it only does so when a directory b exists, otherwise a directory b
  is created with copy of contents of a).
- fixed bug 221 (getParentFile) in LocalFileAdaptor.
- various fixes in the Zorilla adaptor.
- various fixes and updates in the glite adaptor.

FIXED BUGS in version 2.0.3 with respect to version 2.0.2

- fixed the compilation of the contributed adaptors (bug reported by Alexander Beck-Ratzka)
- fixed some tests: preferences were set, but not passed on to GAT.create() methods.
- resource brokers now accept only proper URIs (using the right scheme for the specific adaptor or the any scheme) (bug reported by Niels Drost)
- zorilla adaptor updated
- fault tolerance optimization in LogicalFileCpi.replicate as proposed by Enric Tejedor
- glite-adaptor: support for inputdata jdl attribute

FIXED BUGS in version 2.0.2 with respect to version 2.0.1

- fixed bug in sshtrilead adaptor for getting files from a remote location to a local location (connection attempt to the wrong side, bug reported by Enric Tejedor).
- modified the File.java toURL method to be compatible with java 1.6 (it's deprecated there)
- fix in the engine: FileCpi.copyDir, it invokes now just the static copyDirectory
- fix in default adaptor order policy (adaptors were wrongly ordered, bug reported by Mathijs den Burger)

FIXED BUGS in version 2.0.1 with respect to version 2.0

- GlobusFileAdaptor: renameTo failed if the passed URI wasn't on the same host as the file. (Bug reported by Alexander Beck-Ratzka)
- LogicalFileCpi: underlying storage of the files belonging to the logicalfile is now done in a Vector and is synchronized (previously it wasn't synchronized in an ArrayList). (Bug reported by Enric Tejedor)
- javagat.properties: updated to reflect all preferences and their defaults.
- GliteAdaptor: added a GliteAdaptor developed by Thomas Zangerl (Thanks a lot!)
- added support for preference <"job.stop.poststage", true|false> which controls whether the job should poststage if the stop method is invoked on this job. (request from Keith Cover)
- FileCpi: improved method recursiveDeleteDirectory, it only does recursive delete if a direct delete fails, this can speed up poststaging and sandbox removal quite a lot.
- LocalResourceBroker: fixed accessing of the path of the sandbox (Bug reported by Hans-Martin Adorf)
- GlobusFileAdaptor: mkdir failed if preference file.chmod wasn't set, it did set the mode to 000, now it takes the umask on the remote machine as default (Bug reported by Hans-Martin Adorf and others)
