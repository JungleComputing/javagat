JavaGAT 2.0
-----------

	- gt4 file adaptor does not check URI. (it accepts aap://xyz)
	DONE
	- Document new securityContext features
- Complete GT4 adaptor set
* test it
* integrate Frank Knoll's advert service adaptors
	- Document all preferences and attributes
	  DONE (attributes.html and preferences.html in doc)
- Make a pass over all javadocs
	- Document GAT.end()
	  Seems to be done
	- Check: sandbox CTRL-C during poststage stops it?
	What do you mean? create a job with some poststaging file and press CTRL+C
	during the poststaging? What should happen? Shutdownhooks etc? Now the sandbox
	dir isn't deleted and the poststaging is stopped. (SubmitRemoteJob6)
	- Create and use InvalidUsernameOrPasswordException
	DONE
- Store VO (virtual organisation) in SecurityContext
	- Cleanup SSH adaptors:
	  * If the executable does not exist, we get no error.
	  CommandlineSsh --> error
	  other adaptors don't depend on executable
	  * Broker does not work to fs3
	  DONE
	  * remove retry code for job submit
	  DONE
      * use a cache to save on connection setup time(also for sftp) --> what about env? unset?
      DONE for sftp, tested with ssh but no improvement (JSch probably caches internally)
	  * support environment vars in ssh broker.
	  DONE
	  * remove old ssh/sftp adaptors?
	  CopyingFileInputStream? It is useless because internally it uses the
	  CommandLineSshFileAdaptor and invokes the length method which is not 
	  implemented
- URI file://localhost//score.icme is not handled correctly on windows?
- Look into file permissions for Keith (gridftp)
	- MultiJobs: number of jobs/machine to run concurrently
	DONE
	- Check events: globus adaptor should throw all events (PRE_STAGING, SUBMITTED,
	  RUNNING, POST_STAGING, STOPPED).
	Sent a mail to Gregor von Laszewski
- Fix race in globus adaptor: access to shutdownInProgress should be 
  synchronized
- Fix leaking connections with globus. Enric reported that if a 
  GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE is set, globus job submission fails after a while
- Task model?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
JavaGAT 2.1
-----------
- Sandbox: seperate prestaging and sandbox creation (so we can do 
  asynchronous prestaging)
- complete glite adaptor set: Integrate Anna's and Atul's adaptors
- rewrite connection caching: make one framework for all adaptors
- An API for multi-cluster jobs (co-scheduling)
- JSDL interface
- resource broker adaptors should fill in ALL defined states in getInfo call.
- in the engine, check if GAT.end hasn't been called before doing an operation.
- brokering: also allow output to be printed on the screen, when no output files
  are given.
  maybe use special property for this? Not all middlewares can do this.
- merge stdout and stderr into one file
- Integrate Koala adaptor



Long term
---------

- fix firing of metrics: store unsubscribe / subscribe until a good moment, 
  don't handle them in the upcall itself
- implement GATSelf
- Think about the case where an adaptor throws an exception because there is an
  irrecoverable
  error (file does not exists). In this case, there is no need to try the other
  adaptors.
- feature to disable intelligent dispatching for certain API types (streams)
  and/or let streams save file pointer
