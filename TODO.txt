- format TODOs and readmes in HTML (to avoid linebreak problems windows/linux)
- fix firing of metrics: store unsubscribe / subscribe until a good moment, 
  don't handle them in the upcall itself
- document preferences
- implement GATSelf
- Allow adaptor.name preference to be a list
- Think about the case where an adaptor throws an exception because there is an irrecoverable
  error (file does not extist). In this case, there is no need to try the other adaptors.
- brokering: also allow output to be printed on the sceen, when no output files are given.
  maybe use special property for this? Not all middlewares can do this.

  SSH: - If the executable does not exist, we get no error.
       - Broker does not work to fs3
       - Also add retry code for file stransfers (already done for job submit)
       - use a cache to save on connection setup time(also for sftp)
       - remote streaming seems to hang
       - cache connections for ssh adaptor (Ana?)
       - support environment vars in ssh broker.

- resource broker adaptors should fill in ALL defined states in the getInfo call.
- GAT_LOCATION -> JAVAGAT_HOME

- in the engine, check if GAT.end hasn't been called before doing an operation.

%% things to fix in GAT:
%% - add InvalidUsernameOrPasswordException
%% - add feature to disable intelligent dispatching for certain API types (streams)
%% - and/or let streams save file pointer
