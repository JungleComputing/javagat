FIXED BUGS AND ADDITIONS in trunk version with respect to version 2.0.5
- adaptor order was not quite deterministic yet, so that different copies
  of the same javagat release could have different behaviour.
- FTP file adaptor copy method did CR-LF translation on copy.
- FileCpi.getParentFile() was wrong in case of an absolute URI with a
  relative path where the host part refers to the local host.
- Zorilla adaptor now sets up connection lazily and not in the resource broker
  constructor --> avoids 30-second delay.
- gat.adaptor.path System property now again indicates a File.pathSeparator-
  separated path of directories (as it used to do in version 1.7).
- work in progress on the Unicore adaptor to make a unicore job advertisable,
  so that another javaGAT instance can later obtain the results.

FIXED BUGS AND ADDITIONS in version 2.0.5 with respect to version 2.0.4
- Alexander Beck-Ratzka contributed a Unicore resourcebroker adaptor.
- the Ganymed sftp adaptor has been replaced with a Trilead sftp adaptor.
- removed sftp and sftpnew adaptors as they are obsoleted by the
  Trilead sftp adaptor.
- JavaGAT now uses slf4j as logging system. This means that you can use
  your favorite logging system, as long as there is an slf4j implementation
  for it. To accomplish that, you need to put the appropriate slf4j jar-file
  in front of your classpath. If, like before, you want to use log4j, you
  don't have to do anything, since this is the default.
- the GATEngine now supports a "shared" jar-file directory, which allows
  adaptors to share some of their dependencies, so that these are loaded
  with the same classloader. This is useful for for instance security
  objects that need to be shared by several adaptors.
  See the file doc/adaptors/whySharedDirectory.txt.
- there was an error in the unmarshal method of the LogicalFileCpi, which
  made it impossible to unmarshal an advertized logicalfile.
- there was a bug in the fixURI method of the FileCpi which sometimes made
  it refer to a wrong location.
- when staging in a file with an absolute source path and no explicit
  destination, the file was staged to the wrong location (not the sandbox).
- an explicit check for null job arguments was added, so that an exception
  is thrown when the job description is created, instead of further on when
  the job is run.
- fixed various problems in the Globus and FTP file adaptor. This is tricky
  stuff because different servers behave differently! We have tested with
  various servers, and it seems to work now, but your mileage may vary!
- the Koala adaptor is now functional.
- the sshtrilead file adaptor sometimes failed because warnings were printed
  on stderr. Now, these warnings are ignored (see bug #256).
- added a list method for the CommandlineSshFileAdaptor.
- protect executable and arguments against shell meta character expansion
  in the Gridsam resource broker adaptor.
- some API has been added for file permissions. This basically is jdk7 stuff.
  For now, gLite is the only adaptor that implements (some of) it.
  org.gridlab.gat.io.File now has a method getFileAttributeView().
- a special version of the GATEngine has been added for Android.
- there has been a lot of development on the various gLite adaptors.
- the Zorilla adaptor has been improved considerably.

FIXED BUGS in version 2.0.4 with respect to version 2.0.3

- fixed a couple of glitches in the tests.
- The Glite adaptor has seen various updates and fixes, but its file
  adaptor is still to be considered "experimental", according to the developers.
- various fixes in the Globus File adaptor.
- a couple of fixes in the sshtrilead file adaptor, for operations on
  non-existent files. Also, its getAbsolutePath() implementation was wrong.
- File.getName() returned null in some cases, which is a no-no. This is fixed,
  and this also fixes bug 187.
- re-implemented metrics administration. The old method maintained static lists
  inside GATEngine which were never cleaned up, so that there was a huge memory
  leak because the engine kept references to all jobs that were ever run.
  Now, the lists are maintained within the monitorable object itself and are
  no longer static. This fixes bug 134.
- fixed stop() method of almost all resourcebroker adaptors: the method
  may now be called in any job state, as promised in the javadoc.
- fixed wsgt4new resourcebroker adaptor to actually use a user-supplied
  credential (bug reported by Ralf Groeper).
- fixed sshtrilead and commandlinessh resource broker adaptors to prevent
  expansion of shell-meta-characters, and to make them work in case the
  shell on the server side is a C-shell (bug reported by Kees van Reeuwijk).
- made resourcebrokeradaptor test work when server is a Solaris machine
  (which has slightly different error messages).
- fixed wsgt4new resourcebroker adaptor to use a supplied GSSCredential (bug
  reported by Ralf Groeper).
- fixed classloader issue: use either the classloader of the class that
  prompted the loading of JavaGAT or the context classloader, for the
  parent of the URL classloaders for the adaptors (bug reported by
  Ralf Groeper).
- fixed globus security utils: if the CredentialSecurityObject already
  contains a GSSCredential, just return that instead of ignoring it
  (bug reported by Ralf Groeper).
- fixed commandrunner: now uses ProcessBuilder. This protects against local
  expansion of shell meta characters.
- fixed a bug reported by Brian Carpenter: wsgt4new resourcebroker adaptor
  sometimes gave redundant callbacks when the job was already finished,
  for instance, a redundant POST_STAGING callback, which caused overwriting of
  initially correct output files.
- fixed copy method to mimic cp -r behaviour when copying directories.
  (copy dir a to b ended up as a copy b/a, even if b did not exist,
  now it only does so when a directory b exists, otherwise a directory b
  is created with copy of contents of a).
- fixed bug 221 (getParentFile) in LocalFileAdaptor.
- various fixes in the Zorilla adaptor.
- various fixes and updates in the glite adaptor.

FIXED BUGS in version 2.0.3 with respect to version 2.0.2

- fixed the compilation of the contributed adaptors (bug reported by Alexander Beck-Ratzka)
- fixed some tests: preferences were set, but not passed on to GAT.create() methods.
- resource brokers now accept only proper URIs (using the right scheme for the specific adaptor or the any scheme) (bug reported by Niels Drost)
- zorilla adaptor updated
- fault tolerance optimization in LogicalFileCpi.replicate as proposed by Enric Tejedor
- glite-adaptor: support for inputdata jdl attribute

FIXED BUGS in version 2.0.2 with respect to version 2.0.1

- fixed bug in sshtrilead adaptor for getting files from a remote location to a local location (connection attempt to the wrong side, bug reported by Enric Tejedor).
- modified the File.java toURL method to be compatible with java 1.6 (it's deprecated there)
- fix in the engine: FileCpi.copyDir, it invokes now just the static copyDirectory
- fix in default adaptor order policy (adaptors were wrongly ordered, bug reported by Mathijs den Burger)

FIXED BUGS in version 2.0.1 with respect to version 2.0

- GlobusFileAdaptor: renameTo failed if the passed URI wasn't on the same host as the file. (Bug reported by Alexander Beck-Ratzka)
- LogicalFileCpi: underlying storage of the files belonging to the logicalfile is now done in a Vector and is synchronized (previously it wasn't synchronized in an ArrayList). (Bug reported by Enric Tejedor)
- javagat.properties: updated to reflect all preferences and their defaults.
- GliteAdaptor: added a GliteAdaptor developed by Thomas Zangerl (Thanks a lot!)
- added support for preference <"job.stop.poststage", true|false> which controls whether the job should poststage if the stop method is invoked on this job. (request from Keith Cover)
- FileCpi: improved method recursiveDeleteDirectory, it only does recursive delete if a direct delete fails, this can speed up poststaging and sandbox removal quite a lot.
- LocalResourceBroker: fixed accessing of the path of the sandbox (Bug reported by Hans-Martin Adorf)
- GlobusFileAdaptor: mkdir failed if preference file.chmod wasn't set, it did set the mode to 000, now it takes the umask on the remote machine as default (Bug reported by Hans-Martin Adorf and others)
