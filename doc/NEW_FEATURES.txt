- added Preference: xxx.adaptor.name to be a list (see javadoc of Preferences for
  more information about the syntax)
  
- added attribute "getRemoteSandboxOutputURI" for SoftwareDescription. 
  The standard out and standard error will be written to the given URI appended
  by ".X.out" and ".X.err" where X is a counter
  
- logging uses log4j (see: http://logging.apache.org/log4j/) the logging properties
  should be configured using the log4j.properties file in the $GAT_LOCATION dir.
  logging using the commandline parameters (-Dgat.verbose and -Dgat.debug) is still
  possible and overrides the configuration of the log4j.properties file.
  
- upgraded code to java 1.5

- added multicore support for RemoteSandbox jobs.
  to use the multicore functionality of a resourcebroker use the methods
  broker.beginMultiCoreJob();
  job = broker.submitJob(jobDescription);
  ...
  job_n = broker.submitJob(jobDescription_n);
  broker.endMultiCoreJob();
  The submitJob returns a (local) RemoteSandboxJob, a job that has 1 to 1 relation 
  with the (remote) sandbox job. The RemoteSandboxJob monitors the status of the 
  sandbox job by means of reading a status file (any://localhost/.status_<jobID>_<random>)
  
- moved the RemoteSandboxSubmitter to the engine, may also be used with other adaptors

- created extra security context: CredentialSecurityContext, to store for instance
  GSScredentials.
  
- modified the CertificateSecurityContext to hold also a certfile (in addition to
  the keyfile)

- removed the preference "userCert" --> use CredentialSecurityContext instead

- changed the GlobusSecurityUtils. To retrieve a GSSCredential:
  1. check the securitycontexts
  1.1 check the credentialsecuritycontexts (GssCredential or proxy-cert in byte[] or String)
  1.2 check the certificatesecuritycontexts (Passphrase + certfilelocation + keyfilelocation)
  2. check the environment variable
  3. check the default location 
  Using 1.2 the JavaGAT can submit a globus job from a local machine with only the JavaGAT
  (and the including CoG) installed and without having Globus installed. 
  The following files (described by their default location) should be available 
  at the local machine:
  .globus/userkey.pem
  .globus/usercert.pem
  .globus/certificates (dir) or /etc/grid-security/certificates (also dir)
