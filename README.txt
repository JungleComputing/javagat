Hi,

This is the Java implementation of the GridLab GAT (Grid Application Toolkit).
You normally install this software on your workstation or laptop, you don't 
have to install it on the grid sites you want to use.
Documentation for this release is located in the directory JavaGATEngine/docs.
Fore more info on the GAT in general, see www.gridlab.org.
This software consists of two parts. The GAT engine and the GAT adaptors.
You have to build them both, the engine first.
For more information, see the README.txt files in the two subdirectories here.

Cheers,

Rob
