Hi,

This is the Java implementation of the GridLab GAT (Grid Application Toolkit).
You normally install this software on your workstation or laptop, you don't 
have to install it on the grid sites you want to use.
Documentation for this release is located in the directory "docs", including the language-
independant specification of the GAT interface, and a tutorial for the Java GAT.

Fore more info on the GAT in general, see www.gridlab.org.

This software consists of two parts. The GAT engine and the GAT adaptors (the GAT adaptors
are further split up into "adaptors" and "gridlabAdaptors". The latter are only useful 
if you have installed GridLab software such as GRMS or Mercury.
You can build the Java GAT by typing "ant" in the package root directory.
For more information, see the README.txt files in the "engine" and "adaptors" 
subdirectories here.

Cheers,

Rob
