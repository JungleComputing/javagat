In short, you write an adaptor by extending the CPI class.  A good
starting point is the LocalFile adaptor in
src/org/gridlab/gat/io/cpi/local/LocalFileAdaptor.java

It extends the FileCPI class, and extends the methods in that class.
You don't have to implement all methods. The JavaGAT has late binding,
so if a method does not exist for a particular adaptor, the engine
will select another adaptor automatically...
