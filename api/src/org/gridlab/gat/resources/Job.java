/**
 * An instance of this class represents a job.
 * <p>
 * A job is the entire process of (1) getting an application to execute on some
 * location, (2) the actual execution of the application and (3) the cleanup
 * after the execution.
 * <p>
 * A job will be constructed by a {@link ResourceBroker} according to a
 * description of it, the {@link JobDescription}.
 * <p>
 * A job object always has an associated state and can be polled for this state.
 * Examples of state sequences are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>INITIAL, PRE_STAGING, SCHEDULED, RUNNING, POST_STAGING, STOPPED</li>
 * <li>INITIAL, RUNNING, ON_HOLD, RUNNING, STOPPED</li>
 * <li>PRE_STAGING, SUBMISSION_ERROR</li>
 * </ul>
 * The following relations are true for the state order:
 * <ul>
 * <li>PRE_STAGING < RUNNING </li>
 * <li>SCHEDULED < RUNNING </li>
 * <li>RUNNING < POST_STAGING</li>
 * <li>POST_STAGING < STOPPED</li>
 * <li>POST_STAGING < SUBMISSION_ERROR</li>
 * </ul>
 * It depends on the implementation of the Job in the adaptor which states are
 * supported for that adaptor. For instance a local job might never be in the
 * state SCHEDULED.
 * <p>
 * It's also possible to add a listener to a Job object which can listen to a
 * metric that the job provides. Most Jobs provide at least the metric
 * "job.status", which will indicate state changes. Note that it is possible to
 * receive a state twice, or that some states may never occur.
 * <p>
 * Furthermore, if you want to listen to metric that's firing metrics during the
 * creation of the Job object (which is done by the {@link ResourceBroker}),
 * you can add the listener and the metric name to the submitJob method in the
 * {@link ResourceBroker}.
 * <p>
 * Note that adaptors might not implement the whole functionality.
