/**
 * An instance of this class is a description of a hardware resource, a physical
 * entity, which a may be required by a hardware or software component.
 * <p>
 * 
 * To clarify the concept of a {@link HardwareResourceDescription}, let us give
 * various examples. Memory is described by a
 * {@link HardwareResourceDescription}; a network is described by a
 * {@link HardwareResourceDescription}; disk space is described by a
 * {@link HardwareResourceDescription}; a monitor is described a
 * {@link HardwareResourceDescription}\ldots However, an application is not
 * described by a {@link HardwareResourceDescription}. In general any resource
 * which corresponds to a physical entity is described by a
 * {@link HardwareResourceDescription}.
 * <p>
 * Hardware is generally useless without software. For example, a disk drive
 * without the appropriate software driver is all but useless. Similarly,
 * hardware often depends upon other hardware. For example, having a disk drive
 * without a computer again is not of much use. Hence, in describing a hardware
 * component one needs to also describe the software and hardware that this
 * hardware component requires. This is reflected in the fact that a
 * {@link HardwareResourceDescription} contains in addition to a description of
 * a hardware component a list of {@link HardwareResourceDescription}s, each
 * element of which describes a hardware component upon which the parent
 * hardware component depends. It also contains a list of
 * {@link SoftwareResourceDescription}s, each element of which describes a
 * software component upon which the parent hardware component depends. Hence,
 * the entire structure is recursive.
 * <p>
 * To construct an instance of a {@link HardwareResourceDescription} one
 * requires three quantities:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A map which contains a set of name/value pairs, detailed later, which
 * describe a hardware resource.</li>
 * <li>A list of {@link SoftwareResourceDescription} instances each of which
 * describes a software resource upon which the parent hardware resource
 * depends.</li>
 * <li>A list of {@link HardwareResourceDescription} instances each of which
 * describes a hardware resource upon which the parent hardware resource
 * depends.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The GAT-API defines a minimum set of supported name/value pairs which can be
 * included in the Map used to construct a HardwareResourceDescription instance.
 * This minimum set of name/value pairs MUST be supported by any implementation
 * of the GAT-API. This minimum set of supported name/values is given in the
 * table.
