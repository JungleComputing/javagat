/**
 * An instance of this class is a description of a hardware resource, a physical
 * entity, which a may be required by a hardware or software component.
 * <p>
 *
 * To clarify the concept of a HardwareResourceDescription, let us give various
 * examples. Memory is described by a HardwareResourceDescription; a network is
 * described by a HardwareResourceDescription; disk space is described by a
 * HardwareResourceDescription; a monitor is described a
 * HardwareResourceDescription\ldots However, an application is not described by
 * a HardwareResourceDescription. In general any resource which corresponds to a
 * physical entity is described by a HardwareResourceDescription.
 * <p>
 * Hardware is generally useless without software. For example, a disk drive
 * without the appropriate software driver is all but useless. Similarly,
 * hardware often depends upon other hardware. For example, having a disk drive
 * without a computer again is not of much use. Hence, in describing a hardware
 * component one needs to also describe the software and hardware that this
 * hardware component requires. This is reflected in the fact that a
 * HardwareResourceDescription contains in addition to a description of a
 * hardware component a list of HardwareResourceDescriptions, each element of
 * which describes a hardware component upon which the parent hardware component
 * depends. It also contains a list of SoftwareResourceDescriptions, each element of which
 * describes a software component upon which the parent hardware component
 * depends. Hence, the entire structure is recursive.
 * <p>
 * To construct an instance of a HardwareResourceDescription one requires three
 * quantities:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A map which contains a set of name/value pairs, detailed later, which
 * describe a hardware resource.</li>
 * <li>A list of SoftwareResourceDescription instances each of which describes
 * a software resource upon which the parent hardware resource depends.</li>
 * <li>A list of HardwareResourceDescription instances each of which describes a
 * hardware resource upon which the parent hardware resource depends.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The GAT-API defines a minimum set of supported name/value pairs which can be
 * included in the Map used to construct a HardwareResourceDescription
 * instance. This minimum set of name/value pairs MUST be supported by any
 * implementation of the GAT-API. This minimum set of supported name/values is
 * given in the table
