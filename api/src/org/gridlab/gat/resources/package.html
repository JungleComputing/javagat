<p>This package contains the classes and interfaces which are
used for using resources, be they hardware or software resources. The most
important classes and interfaces in this package are ResourceBroker and
Reservation. An instance of the class ResourceBroker represents a broker for
resources and is used to reserve and find resources. An instance of the class Reservation
represents a reservation for a resource and is used to manipulate this
reservation.</p>

<p>The most important classes and interfaces dealing with hardware resources are HardwareResourceDescription and HardwareResource.
An instance of the class HardwareResourceDescription represents a description of
a hardware resource and is used to describe such. An instance of the class
HardwareResource represents a hardware resource and is used to manipulate such.
</p>

<p>The most important classes and interfaces dealing with software resources are SoftwareResourceDescription, and Job.
An instance of the class SoftwareResourceDescription
represents a description of a software resource and is used to describe such.
Jobs represent running tasks on a grid site.
</p>

<p>The classes in this package are related to each other as follows. A JobDescription contains a SoftwareDescription
and either a ResourceDescription or a Resource object. The method submitJob of the 
ResourceBroker creates a Job out of the JobDescription. The ResourceDescription object as well as
the Resource object are abstract and have subclasses for hardware and software (called HardwareResourceDescription, HardwareResource, SoftwareResourceDescription and SoftwareResource).
There's also a special convenience sub type of the SoftwareDescription, the JavaSoftwareDescription, which
makes it easier to create a description of a java application. The ResourceBroker cannot only turn JobDescriptions
into Jobs, but also pairs of Resources (or ResourceDescriptions) and TimePeriods into Reservations.
