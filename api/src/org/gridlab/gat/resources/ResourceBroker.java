/**
 * An instance of this class is used to submit {@link Job}s or to reserve
 * {@link Resource}s. A {@link ResourceBroker} can be created using the factory
 * methods of the {@link GAT} object (for instance
 * GAT.createResourceBroker(gatContext, preferences, brokerURI)). Each
 * {@link ResourceBroker} has a location which can be expressed using a
 * {@link URI}. This {@link URI} should be passed to the factory method.
 * <p>
 * First of all, the {@link ResourceBroker} can be used to submit {@link Job}s.
 * A {@link Job} is described by a {@link JobDescription}. Using the one of the
 * submitJob methods of the {@link ResourceBroker}, one can create a
 * {@link Job} out of the {@link JobDescription}.
 * <p>
 * The {@link ResourceBroker} can also be used to reserve {@link Resource}s. A
 * {@link Resource} can either be a {@link HardwareResource} or a
 * {@link SoftwareResource}. A {@link SoftwareResource} is simply an
 * executable, therefore it makes little sense to reserve such. Thus, an
 * instance of this class can currently only reserve a hardware resource.
 * <p>
 * If one wishes to reserve a {@link HardwareResource}, one must first describe
 * it. This is accomplished by creating an instance of the class
 * {@link HardwareResourceDescription}. After creating such an instance, one
 * must specify the time period for which one wishes to reserve the
 * {@link HardwareResource}. This is accomplished by creating an instance of
 * the class {@link TimePeriod}, which specifies the time period for which one
 * wishes to reserve the {@link HardwareResource}. Finally, one must obtain a
 * reservation for the desired {@link HardwareResource} for the desired
 * {@link TimePeriod}. This is accomplished by calling the method
 * reserveHardwareResource() on an instance of the class {@link ResourceBroker}
 * with the appropriate instance of {@link HardwareResourceDescription} and the
 * appropriate instance of {@link TimePeriod}.
 * <p>
 * In addition, an instance of this class can be used to find
 * {@link HardwareResource}s. This is accomplished by creating an instance of
 * the class {@link HardwareResourceDescription} which describes the
 * {@link HardwareResource} that one wishes to find. After creating such an
 * instance, one must find the corresponding {@link HardwareResource}. This is
 * accomplished by calling the method findHardwareResources() on an instance of
 * the class {@link ResourceBroker} with the appropriate instance of
 * {@link HardwareResourceDescription}.
