<p>
This package contains classes and interfaces which are used to provide input and output. Files and streams can be either local or remote.
The most
important classes and interfaces are File, LogicalFile, the stream classes, 
and the corresponding capability provider interfaces. An instance
of the class File is an abstract representation of a physical file and is used
to perform operations on an entire file. An instance of the class LogicalFile
is an abstract representation of a set of identical physical files and is used
to facilitate data transfer. InputStreams and OutputStreams
are used to perform IO. The various capability provider interfaces are used by an
adaptor writer to implement the functionality contained in this package.</p>
