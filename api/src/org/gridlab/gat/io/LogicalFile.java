/**
 * An abstract representation of a set of identical physical files.
 * <p>
 * A LogicalFile is an abstract representation of a set of identical physical
 * files. This abstraction is useful for a number of reasons. For example, if
 * one wishes to replicate a physical file which is at one URI to a second URI.
 * Normally, one takes all the data at the first URI and replicates it to the
 * second URI even though the "network distance" between the first and second
 * URI may be great. A better solution to this problem is to have a set of
 * identical physical files distributed at different locations in "network
 * space". If one then wishes to replicate a physical file from one URI to a
 * second URI, GAT can then first determine which physical file is closest in
 * "network space" to the second URI, chose that physical file as the source
 * file, and copy it to the destination URI. Similarly, the construct of a
 * LogicalFile allows for migrating programs to use the physical file in
 * "network space" that is closest to its physical location.
