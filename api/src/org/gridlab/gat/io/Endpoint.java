/**
 * An Endpoint represents an endpoint of a {@link Pipe}. An Endpoint can be
 * created, and listened to, and connected to.
 * 
 * An Endpoint represents an end of a byte stream. Depending on how a Endpoint
 * gets created, it can be listened to or connected to. In both cases, the
 * endpoint returns a {@link Pipe}. Hence, a Endpoint acts in fact as a
 * {@link Pipe} factory: multiple {@link Pipe}s can be created from it by
 * repeatedly listening for incoming connections. The behaviour is similar to
 * listening on a BSD socket.
 * 
 * Endpoints obtained from the {@link AdvertService} cannot be listened to.
 * 
 * {@link Pipe}s created from endpoints continue to live after the
 * {@link Endpoint} instance is destroyed.
