/**
 * A file attribute view that provides a view of a <em>basic set</em> of file
 * attributes common to many file systems. The basic set of file attributes
 * consist of <em>mandatory</em> and <em>optional</em> file attributes as
 * defined by the {@link BasicFileAttributes} interface.

 * <p> The file attributes are retrieved from the file system as a <em>bulk
 * operation</em> by invoking the {@link #readAttributes() readAttributes} method.
 * This class also defines the {@link #setTimes setTimes} method to update the
 * file's time attributes.
 *
 * <p> Where dynamic access to file attributes is required, the attributes
 * supported by this attribute view have the following names and types:
 * <blockquote>
 *  <table border="1" cellpadding="8">
 *   <tr>
 *     <th> Name </th>
 *     <th> Type </th>
 *   </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *     <td> "lastModifiedTime" </td>
 *     <td> {@link Long} </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> "lastAccessTime" </td>
 *     <td> {@link Long} </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> "creationTime" </td>
 *     <td> {@link Long} </td>
 *   </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *     <td> "resolution" </td>
 *     <td> {@link java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit} </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> "size" </td>
 *     <td> {@link Long} </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> "isRegularFile" </td>
 *     <td> {@link Boolean} </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> "isDirectory" </td>
 *     <td> {@link Boolean} </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> "isSymbolicLink" </td>
 *     <td> {@link Boolean} </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> "isOther" </td>
 *     <td> {@link Boolean} </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> "linkCount" </td>
 *     <td> {@link Integer} </td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td> "fileKey" </td>
 *     <td> {@link Object} </td>
 *   </tr>
 * </table>

 *
 * <p> The {@link #getAttribute getAttribute} or {@link
 * #readAttributes(String,String[]) readAttributes(String,String[])} methods may
 * be used to read any of these attributes as if by invoking the {@link
 * #readAttributes() readAttributes()} method.
 *
 * <p> The {@link #setAttribute setAttribute} method may be used to update the
 * file's last modified time, last access time or create time attributes as if
 * by invoking the {@link #setTimes setTimes} method. In that case, the time
 * value is interpreted in {@link TimeUnit#MILLISECONDS milliseconds} and
