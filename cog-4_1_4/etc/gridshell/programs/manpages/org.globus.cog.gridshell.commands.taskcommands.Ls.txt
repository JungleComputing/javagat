NAME
  ls - list directory contents

SYNOPIS
  ls [OPTION] [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
  This command needs to have a connection associated with it
  (open). It works when open contains multiple connections and will
  list the files after each machine name associated.


OPTIONS
   [-l, --long]
     flag that says to display long
   [--help]
     displays the options



EXAMPLES

  CORRECT USAGE

  1) listing the current directory

    ls

  2) listing the absolute path /usr/bin/

    ls /usr/bin/

  3) listing the long version of the current directory.

    ls -l

  4) listing the long version of the absolute path /usr/bin/

    ls -l /usr/bin


  INCORRECT USAGE

    1) The below command will not work because currently the way the
       cogkit works is it changes the interanal representation of the
       directory to the path specified. Therefore, when you type
       "ls /usr/b*" it is looking for a directory called "/usr/b*"
       and does not match the wildcard, *, character.

      > ls /usr/b*  

    2) The below command will not work unless /usr/bin/ls is a directory
       for the same reason as #1 will not work. An attept will be made to
       change to the directory /usr/bin/ls and then it will perform an ls
       on that directory. If ls is a file, the cd will fail.

      > ls /usr/bin/ls
