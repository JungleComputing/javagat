OPTIONS
  [--help]
    displays the options


EXAMPLES
  1) To change the current working directory up one level type:

     > cd ..

  2) To change the current working directory to the absolute
     path /usr/bin:

     > cd /usr/bin

  3) To change the current working directory to the relative 
     path www/cgi-bin (so if the user was at /var and typed

     > cd www/cgi-bin   

WARNINGS
   1) While many shells allow a user to simply type "cd" to
   move to the home directory, currently ShellPanel must
   have a path specified.

   2)While many shells allow a user to type "cd -" to move
   to the previous working directory, ShellPanel does not
   support this.

   3) This command is not enabled to work well with the
   group command. If there are more than one connections
   associated with the last open, then it uses the last
   connection.

TO DO
  Allow the user to choose which connection to perform the cd command on when
  multiple connections are associated with the last open.
