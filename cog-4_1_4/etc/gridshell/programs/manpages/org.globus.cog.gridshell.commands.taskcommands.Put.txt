NAME
  put - puts a file from a local machine by copying it to a remote
        machine

SYNOPIS
  put [FROM_URI] [TO_URI]

DESCRIPTION
  This command needs to have a connection associated with it
  (open). It does not work on each machine when open contains multiple
  connections, instead it uses the last connection specified as a
  default. In the future, there should be a selection feature that
  allows to select which connection. This command puts a file from a 
  local machine (FROM_URI) by copying it to a remote machine (TO_URI).

  The FROM_URI and the TO_URI should cotain a valid protocol, host,
  and port number.

  2) Puts a file from the lcoal root directory and places it
  in the working directory of the remote machine.

  3) Puts a file from a level up from the current working
  directory on the local machine and places it on the remote
  machine in the current working directory.
