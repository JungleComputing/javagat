WARNINGS
  This Command is not working because it is being redone to interact with
  the desktop too.

TO DO
  This command has a lot of room for improvement. For example, it is a
  little cumbersome to type set colors and then --foreground
  --background. The colors keyword should not need to be typed.

  The prompt should be able to use %d for a directory being the
  prompt. Other variables should be able to be inserted as the value
  for the prompt.
