NAME
  man - show the manpage for a designated command

SYNOPIS
  man [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
  This command allows users to read about a given command COMMAND.

  ADDING MANPAGES
    Currently adding a manpage is a matter of creating a text file
    that is named class_name.txt (such that CLASS_NAME is the name of
    the command's class) in modules\gridface\src\text\manpages. Then
    simply add the text file to the jar file (easy as running ant dist
    in gridfaces directory, see the gridface documentation for more
    information). It is recommended the user follows the file
    .man-template.txt to produce similar formatted man pages, although
    not required.

  READING MANPAGES
    Each man page should have a similar format as the template
    .man-template.txt describes.  Each manpage has a list of options,
    to further understand how to read these options see "man getopt";
    this man page can be helpful to understand how to pass parameters
    for the examples section as well. Furthermore, examples may have
    comments by using # followed by a comment.
