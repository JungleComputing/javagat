NAME
  getdir - gets a directory from a remote machine and relocates it to the local
           machine

SYNOPIS
  getdir [FROM_URI] [TO_URI]

DESCRIPTION
  This command needs to have a connection associated with it (open). It
  does not work on each machine when open contains multiple connections,
  instead it uses the last connection specified as a default. In the
  future, there should be a selection feature. It copies the directory FROM_URI
  to the directory TO_URI. Both FROM_URI and TO_URI have a valid protocol, host, 
  and port.

OPTIONS
   --help
     displays the options

EXAMPLES
  CORRECT USAGE
    1) Get a directory remotely from the current working
    directory and places it in the root directory of the
    local machine.

      getdir /usr/bin /usr/bin

    2) Get a directory remotely from the current working
    directory and places it in the working directory of the
    local machine.  (Local current working directory will be
    where java was started most likely)

      getdir remoteDir localDir

    3) Get a directory remotely from a level up from the
    current working directory and places it on the local
    machine in the current working directory.

      getdir ../remoteDir localDir
