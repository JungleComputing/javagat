NAME
  get - gets a file from a remote machine and relocates it to the local machine

SYNOPIS
  get [FROM_URI] [TO_URI]

DESCRIPTION
  This command needs to have a connection associated with it (open). It
  does not work on each machine when open contains multiple connections,
  instead it uses the last connection specified as a default. In the future,
  there should be a selection feature. It copies the file FROM_URI to the file 
  TO_URI. Both FROM_URI and TO_URI have a valid protocol, host, and port.

OPTIONS
   [--help]
    displays the options

EXAMPLES
  CORRECT USAGE
    1) Gets a file remotely from the current working directory and places 
      it in the root directory of the local machine.
      
      > get name.TEST /fileName.TEST

    2) Gets a file remotely from the current working directory and places 
      it in the working directory of the local machine.
      (Local current working directory will be where java was started most likely)

      > get name.TEST fileName.TEST

    3) Gets a file remotely from a level up from the current working directory
      and places it on the local machine in the current working directory.

      > get ../name.TEST fileName.TEST
