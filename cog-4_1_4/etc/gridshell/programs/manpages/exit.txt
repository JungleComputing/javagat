NAME
  exit - exits this shell panel
  
SYNOPIS
  exit

DESCRIPTION
  Exits the ShellPanel.

  If the shell panel is in the desktop it closes the current frame. Note
  that this command could be done better, but it would require the ShellPanel
  having a refference to the Desktop. Right now it simply closes by calling 
  getParent a few times and then calling setClosed(true). Later implementations
  may want to allow a property change event to be fired to the desktop.

  If there is an error when trying to call the setClosed(true), then 
  System.exit(-1) is called.

OPTIONS
  [--help]
    displays the options

EXAMPLES
  1) To exit the ShellPanel from either the desktop or standalone Shell enter:

    > exit
