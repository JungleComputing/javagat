Build GATJobRun
===============

NOTE: You need at least GAT.jar & colobus.jar (both part of the JavaGAT Engine) and log4j to build GATJobRun.

1. go to GATJobRun's root directory.

2a. if you use an IDE (such as NetBeans or Eclipse):
      - load the build.xml project and adjust the paths to JavaGAT
        in the properties
      - build/test/run it

2b. if you don't have an IDE:
      - set GAT_LOCATION to point to your JavaGAT installation
      - type: ant -f build-standalone.xml

That's it. The GATJobRun.jar and all dependent libraries are now in the directory dist/


Run GATJobRun
=============

1. go to the director scripts/

2. execute ./gat-job-run and you'll see a brief usage guide.

GATJobRun Examples
==================

- run a simple local job
  ./gat-job-run localhost /bin/ps aux

- run a simple remote job
  ./gat-job-run -username ole -password **** exechost.domain.tld /bin/ps aux
  (It's usefull to supply username/password if you expect the job to be executed via ssh)

- run a simple globus remote job
  1) do a grid-proxy-init to get your credentials
  2) check for ~./globus/cog.properties
     If it doesn't exists copy the cog.properties.sample from the other/ directory
  3) find the line which starts with "ip=" and append your current IP-Address
  4) ./gat-job-run peyote.aei.mpg.de /bin/ps aux
