\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}
In April 2008 \cite{app-engine-intro}, Google launched a platform for building
and hosting web applications on their infrastructure, called the \emph{Google App
Engine} \cite{app-engine-www}. Based on cloud computing technology, Google App
Engine uses multiple servers to run an application and store data. In addition,
Google automatically adjusts the number of servers to handle requests
simultaneously.
