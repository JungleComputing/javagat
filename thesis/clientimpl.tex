\section{Client Implementation}
Below we describe what the client side (Advert class) will look like.

\subsection{HTTP(S) Connections}
Since our client is implemented in pure Java, it is useful to make use of the
\texttt{java.net.URL} class, which allows us to make HTTP connections to the
App Engine. By creating an URL object like shown in Figure \ref{clientimpl-url}.
\begin{figure*}[ht] %[placement] where placement is h,t,b,p
\begin{center}
\begin{code}
URL url = new URL("http://ibis-advert.appspot.com/");

HttpURLConnection httpc = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
\end{code}
\caption{Opening an HTTP Connection.\label{clientimpl-url}}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

Now it's possible with the use of the various functions in both classes to get
all information needed; like status-codes, HTTP Headers, and the message body.
This we will discuss below when we talk about the HTTP response.
In addition to HTTP connections, it is also possible in Java to make HTTPS
connections, however, this is not as straightforward as making HTTP connections.
To make an HTTPS connection we will need to import the
\texttt{java.security.Security} class (amongst others). In addition, if we look
at Figure \ref{clientimpl-https}, we see that the code adds us to the
\texttt{security.provider} list in \texttt{java.security}. After these lines of
code we will be able to make an HTTPS connection just like we did with making
HTTP connection above (i.e. \texttt{url.openConnection()}). All sample code is
fully operational at our branch in the JavaGAT SVN Repository .\begin{figure*}[ht] %[placement] where placement is h,t,b,p
\begin{center}
\begin{code}
Security.addProvider(new com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Provider());

Properties properties = System.getProperties();

String handlers = System.getProperty("java.protocol.handler.pkgs");
if (handlers == null) {
    /* nothing specified yet (expected case) */
    properties.put("java.protocol.handler.pkgs",
        "com.sun.net.ssl.internal.www.protocol");
} 
else {
    /* something already there, put ourselves out front */
    properties.put("java.protocol.handler.pkgs",
        "com.sun.net.ssl.internal.www.protocol|".concat(handlers));
}
System.setProperties(properties);
\end{code}
\caption{Opening an HTTP Connection.\label{clientimpl-https}}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{HTTP POST method}
Secondly it is of great importance to create an HTTP POST request for both
authentication and sending data to the App Engine.
\subsubsection{Sending URL Encoded Strings}
The simplest option is to send a various number of URL encoded strings. An
example of making such an HTTP POST request can be seen in Figure
\ref{clientimpl-post}. We enable sending output to the connection just created,
calling \texttt{urlc.setDoOutput(true);}. After making this call we are able to
open an OutputStreamWriter to which we can write our POST data. Multiple fields are
separated by an ampersand, and variable names and values are separated by the
equal sign. In this example we write the author's name and content to an HTTP
POST request.
\begin{figure*}[ht] %[placement] where placement is h,t,b,p
\begin{center}
\begin{code}
/* Setting up POST environment. */
urlc.setDoOutput(true);
OutputStreamWriter out = new OutputStreamWriter(urlc.getOutputStream());

/* Writing POST data. */
out.write("author=bbn230&content=test");
out.close();
\end{code}
\caption{Making an HTTP POST request.\label{clientimpl-post}}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Sending Binary Data}
In addition to just making HTTP post requests, it is also possible to send binary
data (commonly used for uploading files to web servers via HTTP). Again, this is
a step more difficult. We have to make sure the server expects a binary string of
data. This is shown in Figure \ref{clientimpl-binpost}. After the request hasbeen made, the content can be extracted from the message body by the server andcan be stored accordingly.
\begin{figure*}[ht] %[placement] where placement is h,t,b,p
\begin{center}
\begin{code}
/* Setting up POST environment. */
urlc.setDoOutput(true);
urlc.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/octet-stream");
\end{code}
\caption{Making a binary HTTP POST request.\label{clientimpl-binpost}}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Sending a Combination of Both}
\label{clientimpl-sending-both}
HTTP natively supports a standard for sending a combination of both URL encoded
Strings and binary data. This is specified in \emph{RFC1867}. Although this
would seem perfect for our purposes, we decided not to use this standard for
sending a combination of URL encoded Strings and binary data. RFC1867 specifies
that every part of the message should be seperated by a boundary, chosen by the
client. The downside is that this boundary cannot appear in the content of the
payload. Since our payload can be virtually anything, we decided to go a
different direction, because otherwise we would have to perform a linear search
on all our data to see if a boundary token would accidentally appear in our
payload.

Instead of using boundaries to define the start/end of our payload, we will make
use of special bytes which define the length of our payload. The layout of our
payload is shown in Figure \ldots. To begin with we start by sending the length
of the path, which is our first four bytes. Now the server knows how many bytes
the path will be (which is variable n), after which it knows the meta data will
follow. The meta data also starts with four bytes, indicating the length
(variable m). Finally, the object is sent, again, by sending the object length
as the first four bytes and the object (variable size p) right after that.

Our first attempt of sending the meta data was to structure it like this:
key1=value1: key2=value2: key3=value3: etc. At the client side, we would have to
escape actual content containing the equals sign or a colon, by placing a
backslash in front of them. We had to decode this again at the server side, tomake successful searches. Instead, we will now use the earlier mentioned JSON,which can serialize a MetaData object for us, after which it will look like theString shown in Figure \ref{clientimpl-json}. We can decode this String usingsimplejson at the server side.\begin{figure*}[ht] %[placement] where placement is h,t,b,p
\begin{center}
\begin{code}
{"key1":"value1","key2":"value2","key3":"value3"}
\end{code}
\caption{An example of a serial JSON object.\label{clientimpl-json}}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

After the package is successfully sent, we will receive either a status code 200
(see below), with optionally the TTL as message body. If the transmission failed,
a status code 4xx/5xx will be received, depending on the failure (for example 4xx
can be used if we received a malformed data stream, and 5xx can be used if the
datastore is full).
Note that all three parts need to be sent in one request, because suppose we send
all three parts in separate requests, requests could get lost, which would then
lead to inconsistencies.
\subsection{HTTP(S) Login}
Finally we want to `simulate' the login process through Google accounts. To
achieve this, we need the technique used above: making an HTTPS POST request.
\subsubsection{Google App Engine login page}
We have looked at the login page of a typical App Engine application, and we
have stripped the unnecessary HTML from the login form. As we can see from the
result shown in Figure \ref{clientimpl-loginform}, the login form is quite
comprehensive. The login form has a lot of extra (hidden and redundant) fields,
which we did not expect to find.

\begin{figure*}[ht] %[placement] where placement is h,t,b,p
\begin{center}
\begin{code}
<form id="gaia_loginform" 
action="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLoginAuth?service=ah&amp;sig=d71ef8b8d6150b23958ad03b3bf546b7" 
  method="post"
  onsubmit="return(gaia_onLoginSubmit());">

<input type="hidden" name="ltmpl" value="gm">
<input type="hidden" name="continue" id="continue"
  value="http:// bbn230.appspot.com/_ah/login?continue=http://bbn230.appspot.com/" />
<input type="hidden" name="service" id="service" value="ah" />
<input type="hidden" name="ltmpl" id="ltmpl" value="gm" />
<input type="hidden" name="ltmpl" id="ltmpl" value="gm" />
<input type="hidden" name="ahname" id="ahname" value="Personal" />
<input type="text" name="Email"  id="Email" size="18" value="" />
<input type="password" name="Passwd" id="Passwd" size="18" />
<input type="checkbox" name="PersistentCookie" id="PersistentCookie" value="yes" />
<input type="hidden" name='rmShown' value="1" />
<input type="submit" class="gaia le button" name="signIn" value="Sign in" />
<input type="hidden" name="asts" id="asts" value="">
</form>
\end{code}
\caption{Stripped down version of the App Engine
login page.\label{clientimpl-loginform}}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

We are not sure what all hidden fields do, and if they are really necessary, but
simulating this login page by posting all this would make our HTTP POST request
quite large.
\subsubsection{Google Account Authentication API}
An alternative for simulating the login page is the \emph{Account
Authentication API} \cite{account-auth-api}. The Account Authentication API
comes in two forms. One form for installed \emph{Google Apps}
\cite{google-apps-www}, which is called \emph{ClientLogin}, the other is for WebApps, and is called \emph{OAuth} or \emph{AuthSub}.
\paragraph{ClientLogin}
Typically, ClientLogin is used for Installed applications that need to access
Google services protected by a user's Google or Google Apps. To make use of this
API, we will make a HTTP POST request to
\texttt{https://www.google.com/accounts/ClientLogin}, to which we send our
credentials as shown in Figure \ref{clientimpl-clientlogin}.
\begin{figure*}[ht] %[placement] where placement is h,t,b,p
\begin{center}
\begin{code}
StringBuilder content = new StringBuilder();
content.append("Email=").append(URLEncoder.encode("johndoe@gmail.com", "UTF-8"));
content.append("&Passwd=").append(URLEncoder.encode("north23AZ", "UTF-8"));
content.append("&service=").append(URLEncoder.encode("xapi", "UTF-8"));
content.append("&source=").append(URLEncoder.encode("Google Base data API example", 
  "UTF-8"));
\end{code}
\caption{Preparing our ClientLogin credentials.\label{clientimpl-clientlogin}}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

We created a Google Account for testing purposes and made a successful connection
using that account. The response of the ClientLogin is shown in Figure
\ref{clientimpl-clientlogin-response}.
\begin{figure*}[ht] %[placement] where placement is h,t,b,p
\begin{center}
\begin{code}

Content-Type: text/plain
Cache-control: no-cache, no-store
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: Mon, 01-Jan-1990 00:00:00 GMT

Content-Length: 497

LSID=DQA(...)nSV
Auth=DQA(...)ub4
\end{code}
\caption{A response from ClientLogin.\label{clientimpl-clientlogin-response}}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

\dashline{
Currently, `SID' and `LSID' are not used by the \emph{Google API}, so we just
need to extract the `Auth' value. Usually this value can be used directly on a
service its API (when providing a developer key), but unfortunately, the Google
App Engine is not listed in the Google data API library \cite{service-api}.
There is a workaround for still being able to connect to the App Engine, by
connecting to a App Engine's login page like Figure \ref{clientimpl-aelogin}.
In this example, \texttt{Auth} is a variable that contains the token acquired
by the example of Figure \ref{clientimpl-clientlogin-response}. 
}

\begin{figure*}[ht] %[placement] where placement is h,t,b,p
\begin{center}
\begin{code}
url = new URL("http://bbn230.appspot.com/_ah/login?auth="+ Auth);
\end{code}
\caption{Logging In for a Session Cookie.\label{clientimpl-aelogin}}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

\dashline{
Connecting to this page will return a cookie with a session ID, just like the
one described in Section \ref{clientimpl-cookies}, only with a token called
`ACSID', with which we can identify ourselves to the App Engine for every
subsequent request.
}

\paragraph{AuthSub}
Web applications that need to access services protected by a user's Google or
Google Apps (hosted) account can do so using the Authentication Proxy service. To
maintain a high level of security, the proxy interface, called AuthSub, enables
the web application to get access without ever handling their users' account
login information. Before using, verify that the Google service to be accessed
supports the Authentication service. Some Google services may allow access only
to web applications that are registered and use secure tokens. We have not tried
AuthSub to authenticate ourselves at the App Engine. If the ClientLogin remains
to fail, we could consider AuthSub as our backup. We will not use it as our
primary authentication mechanism because if our users would want to install an
advert server, it would require extra effort, because they need to register
themselves first before this service can be used.

\subsubsection{Cookies}
Also, to maintain session with the server, we want to pass a session ID through
cookies. Also, this can be done through Java by setting the appropriate headers.
For example, if we want to send a cookie with the name ``SID'' and the content
``abcde'', we could code this in Java as shown in Figure\ref{clientimpl-cookies-req}. This code will add the cookie to the HTTP request,after which the response headers and body can be fetched.
\begin{figure*}[ht] %[placement] where placement is h,t,b,p
\begin{center}
\begin{code}
urlc.addRequestProperty("Cookie", "SID=abcde");
\end{code}
\caption{Sending cookies in Java.\label{clientimpl-cookies-req}}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{HTTP Response}
After the HTTP request is sent, we are able to receive the HTTP response. To
begin with, we will download the response headers sent by the web server, after
which we can retrieve the body.
\subsubsection{Headers}
How to recieve the headers of an HTTP response is shown in Figure
\ref{clientimpl-headers}. Already, by receiving the response code, we can
distinguish errors from successful requests. Response codes starting with a 1 are
informational and those starting with a 2 mean success. If the response code is
starting with a 3 are used for redirection, and 4 and 5 are used for errors
(client and server respectively). For example: 200 stands for success, 403 for
authentication required, and 404 for not found.
\begin{figure*}[ht] %[placement] where placement is h,t,b,p
\begin{center}
\begin{code}
/* Retrieving headers. */
System.out.println(httpc.getResponseCode());
System.out.println(httpc.getRequestMethod());
for (int i = 0; httpc.getHeaderField(i) != null; i++) {
    System.out.println(httpc.getHeaderField(i));
}
\end{code}
\caption{Retrieving HTTP response headers.\label{clientimpl-headers}}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

After checking the response code, we can retrieve additional headers. In our case
(using the App Engine as our web server), we have listed an example of receiving
a succesful response (Figure \ref{clientimpl-200}), and a not succesful response
(Figure \ref{clientimpl-403}). Again, a status header is sent, followed by the
server type, the date, and some other info. Note that ``Content-Length'' can be
really useful to determine our buffer size in the next step.
\begin{figure*}[ht] %[placement] where placement is h,t,b,p
\begin{center}
\begin{code}
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server: Development/1.0
Date: Wed, 11 Mar 2009 11:25:05 GMT
Cache-Control: no-cache
Content-Type: image/gif
Content-Length: 18006
\end{code}
\caption{Example of HTTP response headers.\label{clientimpl-200}}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}[ht] %[placement] where placement is h,t,b,p
\begin{center}
\begin{code}

Server: Development/1.0

Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 394
\end{code}
\caption{Another example of HTTP response headers.\label{clientimpl-403}}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Cookies}
\label{clientimpl-cookies}
A `special' type of HTTP header that can be retrieved from sending an HTTP
request are cookies. Just like all the other headers, it is retrieved with the
code stated above. When printed to screen, it will look similar to the requestshown in Figure \ref{clientimpl-cookies-resp}. This code above is taken from
retrieving the URL \texttt{http://www.google.nl/}. As you can see, this cookie
consists out of multiple parts, but would normally be stored as one cookie in your
browser. In this case, the cookies name is ``PREF'', and its content is
``ID=8f3c26(\ldots)zrigB6''. Finally it comes with an expiration time and date,
a path, and a domain. This information will be needed when we want to authenticate
ourselves to the App Engine.
\begin{figure*}[ht] %[placement] where placement is h,t,b,p
\begin{center}
\begin{code}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: private, max-age=0

  expires=Fri, 11-Mar-2011 11:57:38 GMT; path=/; domain=.google.nl
Server: gws
\end{code}
\caption{An HTTP response including cookies.\label{clientimpl-cookies-resp}}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Message Body}
Once we've received all headers and parsed them accordingly, we are able to get
the actual body. As we can see from Figure \ref{clientimpl-body}, the most
important thing is getting the stream, provided by the \texttt{getInputStream()}
function. After we have done this, we can basically do anything with our
InputStream. In this case we print it to the console, but we could also save it
in a buffer and manipulate it, or write it do disk, etc. After we are done
receiving the InputStream, we close the InputStream, effectively closing the
connection.\begin{figure*}[ht] %[placement] where placement is h,t,b,p
\begin{center}
\begin{code}
BufferedReader in = 
  new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(httpc.getInputStream()));
String inputLine;

while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {
    System.out.println(inputLine);
}
in.close();
\end{code}
\caption{Retrieving the HTTP response's body.\label{clientimpl-body}}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}
