\section{Benchmarks}
To measure the perfomance of our Advert service solution, we performed
benchmarks on our Google App Engine Advert Service library. We executed a
couple of tests to measure latency, bandwidth, and server-side performance.
Below we describe our benchmarks in more detail.

All measurements below were perfomed on a iMac (specs here \ldots). 

\subsection{Initialization}
Initializing our Advert library can be done in two different ways. First, we
have the public

Total (auth)

Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
	Minimum = 179ms, Maximum = 229ms, Average = 190ms
	
Total (pub)

Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
	Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 1ms, Average = 0ms
