This document describes our attempts to make use of the \emph{Google App Engine}
\cite{app-engine-www} for scientific purposes. The Google App Engine provides
free resources to run a web applications on Google's infrastructure. To realize
this, Google makes use of a framework, which runs in a \emph{Python}
\cite{python-www} environment, and more recently, also features a \emph{Java}
\cite{java-www} environment. We would like to use the resources offered by Google
for scientific purposes concerning the \emph{Ibis} \cite{ibis-www} in particular.
It contains a detailed design of both client and server, as well as
implementation issues and source code.}
