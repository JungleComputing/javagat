<title>The GAT API provides an abstraction layer which abstracts operations</title>

<body>

<p>
The GAT API provides an abstraction layer which abstracts
operations which may need to be Grid-aware in such a way that an application
may be developed and run independently of the underlying middle-ware actually
deployed.</p>

<p>
The GAT consists of a jar,<b>the GAT engine</b>, which all GAT enabled applications have in their
classpath, and a set of adaptors which provide the bindings between the
operations called in the application and the underlying providers, e.g. grid
services.</p>
