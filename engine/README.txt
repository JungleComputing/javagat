Hi,

This is the Java GAT engine; it defines the GAT interface. 
The engine also dynamically loads implementations of the GAT interface into the application,
and forwards GAT API calls to the right adaptor (a "plugin" for specific grid middleware).

The GAT documentation is in the doc directory in the root of the Java GAT package.
The javadoc for the GAT API is also generated there, in the "doc/javadoc" directory.

Cheers,

Rob
