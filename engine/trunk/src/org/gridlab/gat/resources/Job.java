/**
 * An instance of this class represents a job.
 * <p>
 * A job is what one normally considers when referring to a starting a program.
 * Thus, a job is primarily described by the software which is to execute during
 * this job. The description of the software which is to execute during this job
 * is given by an instance of the class SoftwareResourceDescription. As detailed
 * in the description section of the documentation for the class
 * SoftwareResourceDescription, an instance of the class
 * SoftwareResourceDescription describes a software component. uses this
 * description to describe the software which is to execute during this simple
 * job.
 * <p>
 * Upon creating an instance of the class the associated physical job is not
 * immediately running. An instance of the class has various states which it can
 * be in, only one of which maps to a running physical job. In particular the
 * various state are as follows
 * <ul>
 * <li><em>INITIAL</em></li>
 * <li><em>SCHEDULED</em></li>
 * <li><em>RUNNING</em></li>
 * <li><em>STOPPED</em></li>
 * <li><em>SUBMISSION_ERROR</em></li>
 * </ul>
 * A description of the various states diagrammed in figure below is as follows:
 * <center><img src="doc-files/SimpleJob.jpg" height="600" width="150">
 * </center> <em>INITIAL</em> An instance of the class has been constructed,
 * but the method Submit has not yet been successfully called on this instance.
 * <p>
 * <em>SCHEDULED</em> The method Submit has been successfully called on an
 * instance of while the instance was in the Constructed state.
 * <p>
 * <em>RUNNING</em> The physical job corresponding to an instance of a is
 * running.
 * <p>
 * <em>STOPPED</em> The physical job corresponding to an instance of a was
 * running but is not currently running due to a successful call to the method
 * Stop, or the physical job corresponding to an instance of a was running but
 * is not currently running due to the physical job completing.
 * <p>
 * <em>SUBMISSION_ERROR</em> An error occurred while submitting this job.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * In addition a allows one or more Metrics to be monitored.
