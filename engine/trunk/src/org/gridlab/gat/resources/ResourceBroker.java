/**
 * An instance of this class is used to reserve resources or to submit jobs.
 * <p>
 * A resource can either be a hardware resource or a software resource. A
 * software resource is simply an executable it makes little sense to reserve
 * such. Thus an instance of this class can currently only reserve a hardware
 * resource.
 * <p>
 * If one wishes to reserve a hardware resource, one must first describe it.
 * This is accomplished by
 * creating an instance of the class HardwareResourceDescription. After creating such an
 * instance, one must specify the time period for which
 * one wishes to reserve the hardware resource. This is accomplished by creating
 * an instance of the class TimePeriod which specifies the time period for which
 * one wishes to reserve the hardware resource. Finally, one must obtain a
 * reservation for the desired hardware resource for the desired time period.
 * This is accomplished by calling the method reserveHardwareResource() on an
 * instance of the class ResourceBroker with the appropriate instance of
 * HardwareResourceDescription and the appropriate instance of TimePeriod.
 * <p>
 * In addition, an instance of this class can be used to find hardware resources.
 * This is
 * accomplished by creating an instance of the class HardwareResourceDescription
 * which describes the hardware resource that one wishes to find. After creating
 * such an instance, one must find the corresponding
 * hardware resource. This is accomplished by calling the method
 * findHardwareResources() on an instance of the class ResourceBroker with the
 * appropriate instance of HardwareResourceDescription.
 * <p>
 * Finally, jobs can be submitted using this class. To do this, a JobDescription
 * must fist be created. Next, submitJob is called with this description.
