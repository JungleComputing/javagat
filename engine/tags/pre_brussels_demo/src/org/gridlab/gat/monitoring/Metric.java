/**
 * An instance of this class represents a measurable quantity within a
 * monitoring system.There are two classes of metrics a monitoring system must
 * deal with:
 * <ul>
 * <li><em>Local metrics</em> --- Local metrics are metrics that are directly
 * measured on a resource. These can be highly dependent on the physical
 * parameters of the resource. Thus, local metrics originating from two
 * different resources are not necessarily comparable ( E.g. 1 hour CPU time on
 * a 1 GHz Intel processor is different than 1 hour CPU time on an 800 MHz PPC
 * processor although the numeric values are equal.) However resource
 * administrators who know the configuration of the resource need local metrics
 * for detailed monitoring of the status and operation of the resource.</li>
 * <li><em>Grid metrics</em> --- Grid metrics are metrics that have
 * predefined semantics thus, they are resource independent. Grid metrics are
 * derived from one or more local metrics by applying a specific, well defined
 * algorithm (such as unit conversion, aggregation or averaging). Because of
 * this transformation grid metrics may have less precision or they could be
 * less specific but are guaranteed to be comparable between different
 * resources. Unlike local metrics which a local resource is free to change grid
 * metrics must be agreed upon, standardised and introduced by community
 * consensus.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Instances of this class deal with both classes of metrics.
 * <p>
 * A Metric can only be measured if there exists a sensor which can measure the
 * quantity corresponding to the Metric. Such sensors are created by sensor
 * developers and must embedded in a resource to allow the corresponding Metric
 * or Metrics to be measured. (The creation of sensors is beyond the scope of
 * this document and as such will not be covered.) Such sensors, once created,
 * define the Metric or Metrics which they allow to be measured using a metric
 * definitions.
 * <p>
 * A metric definition contains the following information:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Metric name</li>
 * <li>Metric parameters</li>
 * <li>Metric measurement type</li>
 * <li>Metric data type</li>
 * <li>Metric Unit</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <em>Metric name</em> The Metric name is used to identify the metric
 * definition (e.g. CPU usage). It consists of dot separated words, e.g.
 * host.cpu.user. The last component of a metric name is the actual name of the
 * metric, the preceding components are called scope. The scope can be used to
 * group metrics as well as to differentiate between similar metrics defined at
 * different levels (for example, CPU utilisation can be measured on a per-job
 * or per-host level).
 * <p>
 * <em>Metric parameters</em> The Metric parameters field in the metric
 * definition contains the formal definition of the metric parameters. Many
 * metrics can be measured at different places simultaneously. For example, CPU
 * utilisation can be measured on several hosts or grid resources. The metric
 * parameters can be used to distinguish between these different metric
 * instances.
 * <p>
 * <em>Metric measurement type</em> The Metric Measurement type can be
 * <it>continuous </it> meaning data is always available or <it>event-like </it>
 * meaning data only becomes available when some external event happens (e.g. a
 * sensor embedded in an application can send events any time). Continuous
 * metrics are only available using pull model delivery unless the user
 * specifies a measurement frequency. (The reason for this is without a
 * specified measurement frequency there is no event triggering the measurement
 * of a continuous metric.) If the user asks for periodic measurements by
 * specifying a measurement frequency the system will generate periodic events
 * automatically. This avoids polling and allows the system to use the
 * measurement frequency information to optimise measurements.
 * <p>
 * <em>Metric data type</em> The Metric data type contains the definition of
 * the storage used for representing measurement data.
 * <p>
 * <em>Metric Unit</em> The Metric unit specifies the physical unit in which
 * the metric is measured as a java.lang.String. It is only valid for simple
 * numeric types and java.util.List's of these types. In the latter case it
 * means the unit of all elements of the java.util.List.
 * <p>
 * In using the Metric class one must make an instance of the Metric class. One
 * does so using the Metric constructor; it takes the Metric name and concrete
 * values for the Metric parameters and yields a Metric instance. The notion of
 * Metric instances is necessary because the same metric could be measured at
 * different places (e.g. on different hosts) at the same time. Metric instances
 * are used to differentiate between these measurements, e.g. instances of a
 * Metric describing the available memory on a host are distinguished by a
 * parameter containing the hostname.
