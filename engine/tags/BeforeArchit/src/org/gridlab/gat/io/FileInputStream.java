/**
 * A FileStream represents a connection to open file, the file may be either

 * <p>
 * A FileStream represents a seekable connection to a file and has semantics
 * similar to a standard Unix filedescriptor. It provides methods to query the
 * current position in the file and to seek to new positions.
 * <p>
 * To Write data to a FileStream it is necessary to construct a Buffer and pack
 * it with data. Similarly, to read data a buffer must be created to store the
 * read data. Writes and reads may either be blocking, or asynchronous.
 * Asynchronous writes or reads must be completed by appropriate call.
