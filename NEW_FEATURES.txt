- added Preference: xxx.adaptor.name to be a list (see javadoc of Preferences for
  more information about the syntax)
- added attribute "getRemoteSandboxOutputURI" for SoftwareDescription. 
  The standard out and standard error will be written to the given URI appended
  by ".X.out" and ".X.err" where X is a counter
- logging uses log4j (see: http://logging.apache.org/log4j/) the logging properties
  should be configured using the log4j.properties file in the $GAT_LOCATION dir.
  logging using the commandline parameters (-Dgat.verbose and -Dgat.debug) is still
  possible and overrides the configuration of the log4j.properties file.
- added multicore support for RemoteSandbox jobs.
  use:
  broker.beginMultiCoreJob();
    broker.submitJob(jobDescription1);
    broker.submitJob(jobDescription2);
    ...
    broker.submitJob(jobDescriptionN);
  Job multicoreJob = broker.endMultiCoreJob();
  NOTE: broker.submitJob(JobDescription) will return null in MultiCore mode
- added single upload of the GAT for RemoteSandbox jobs. Use the Preference 
  "singleRemoteGAT", "true" to enable this. The GlobusResourceBroker uploads
  the GAT to a (internally) well known place (.tempGAT) and all jobs can use
  this GAT to start the RemoteSandbox. Upon GAT.end() the remote GAT will be
  deleted.
